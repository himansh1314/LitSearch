What papers discuss the effect of false negatives among hard negatives in dense retriever training?,Debiased Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Sentence Representations,"Recently, contrastive learning has been shown to be effective in improving pre-trained language models (PLM) to derive high-quality sentence representations. It aims to pull close positive examples to enhance the alignment while push apart irrelevant negatives for the uniformity of the whole representation space. However, previous works mostly adopt in-batch negatives or sample from training data at random. Such a way may cause the sampling bias that improper negatives (e.g., false negatives and anisotropy representations) are used to learn sentence representations, which will hurt the uniformity of the representation space. To address it, we present a new framework DCLR (Debiased Contrastive Learning of unsupervised sentence Representations) to alleviate the influence of these improper negatives. In DCLR, we design an instance weighting method to punish false negatives and generate noise-based negatives to guarantee the uniformity of the representation space. Experiments on seven semantic textual similarity tasks show that our approach is more effective than competitive baselines. Our code and data are publicly available at the link: https: //github.com/RUCAIBox/DCLR.",True,248496439,"""How does the DCLR framework address the issue of false negatives in contrastive learning of unsupervised sentence representations?"",","""The DCLR framework, described in 'Debiased Contrastive Learning of Unsupervised Sentence Representations,' mitigates the impact of false negatives by incorporating an instance weighting method.

Can you point me to a paper that discussed transformer-based sentence embeddings?,Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks,"BERT(Devlin et al., 2018)and RoBERTa (Liu  et al., 2019)  has set a new state-of-the-art performance on sentence-pair regression tasks like semantic textual similarity (STS). However, it requires that both sentences are fed into the network, which causes a massive computational overhead: Finding the most similar pair in a collection of 10,000 sentences requires about 50 million inference computations (~65 hours) with BERT. The construction of BERT makes it unsuitable for semantic similarity search as well as for unsupervised tasks like clustering.In this publication, we present Sentence-BERT (SBERT), a modification of the pretrained BERT network that use siamese and triplet network structures to derive semantically meaningful sentence embeddings that can be compared using cosine-similarity. This reduces the effort for finding the most similar pair from 65 hours with BERT / RoBERTa to about 5 seconds with SBERT, while maintaining the accuracy from BERT.We evaluate SBERT and SRoBERTa on common STS tasks and transfer learning tasks, where it outperforms other state-of-the-art sentence embeddings methods. 1",True,201646309,"""How does Sentence-BERT (SBERT) improve the efficiency and quality of sentence embeddings compared to traditional BERT models?"",","""The paper 'Sentence-BERT: Sentence Embeddings using Siamese BERT-Networks' demonstrates that SBERT modifies BERT by employing siamese and triplet network structures.

What are some scholarly articles that explore scaling laws for parameter-efficient prompt tuning techniques for fine-tuning language models?,The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning,"In this work, we explore ""prompt tuning,"" a simple yet effective mechanism for learning ""soft prompts"" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ""prefix tuning"" of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches. Finally, we show that conditioning a frozen model with soft prompts confers benefits in robustness to domain transfer and enables efficient ""prompt ensembling.""

Which paper proposes a memory-efficient optimizer considering the confidence of each update during the optimization?,CAME: Confidence-guided Adaptive Memory Efficient Optimization,"Adaptive gradient methods, such as Adam and LAMB, have demonstrated excellent performance in the training of large language models. Nevertheless, the need for adaptivity requires maintaining second-moment estimates of the per-parameter gradients, which entails a high cost of extra memory overheads. To solve this problem, several memory-efficient optimizers (e.g., Adafactor) have been proposed to obtain a drastic reduction in auxiliary memory usage, but with a performance penalty. In this paper, we first study a confidence-guided strategy to reduce the instability of existing memory efficient optimizers. Based on this strategy, we propose CAME to simultaneously achieve two goals: fast convergence as in traditional adaptive methods, and low memory usage as in memory-efficient methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the training stability and superior performance of CAME across various NLP tasks such as BERT and GPT-2 training. Notably, for BERT pre-training on the large batch size of 32,768, our proposed optimizer attains faster convergence and higher accuracy compared with the Adam optimizer.

What research exists on using reinforcement learning methods for event prediction in temporal knowledge graphs?,TimeTraveler: Reinforcement Learning for Temporal Knowledge Graph Forecasting,"Temporal knowledge graph (TKG) reasoning is a crucial task that has gained increasing research interest in recent years. Most existing methods focus on reasoning at past timestamps to complete the missing facts, and there are only a few works of reasoning on known TKGs to forecast future facts. Compared with the completion task, the forecasting task is more difficult and faces two main challenges:(1) how to effectively model the time information to handle future timestamps? (2) how to make inductive inference to handle previously unseen entities that emerge over time? To address these challenges, we propose the first reinforcement learning method for forecasting. Specifically, the agent travels on historical knowledge graph snapshots to search for the answer. Our method defines a relative time encoding function to capture the timespan information, and we design a novel time-shaped reward based on Dirichlet distribution to guide the model learning. Furthermore, we propose a novel representation method for unseen entities to improve the inductive inference ability of the model.

Which multimodal large language model represents visual data as the discrete tokens like text and training with the unified next-token prediction objective?,UNIFIED LANGUAGE-VISION PRETRAINING IN LLM WITH DYNAMIC DISCRETE VISUAL TOKENIZATION,"TE VISUAL TOKENIZATION

Recently, the remarkable advance of the Large Language Model (LLM) has inspired researchers to transfer its extraordinary reasoning capability to both vision and language data.However, the prevailing approaches primarily regard the visual input as a prompt and focus exclusively on optimizing the text generation process conditioned upon vision content by a frozen LLM.Such an inequitable treatment of vision and language heavily constrains the model's potential.In this paper, we break through this limitation by representing both vision and language in a unified form.Specifically, we introduce a well-designed visual tokenizer to translate the non-linguistic image into a sequence of discrete tokens like a foreign language that LLM can read.The resulting visual tokens encompass high-level semantics worthy of a word and also support dynamic sequence length varying from the image.Coped with this tokenizer, the presented foundation model called LaVIT can handle both image and text indiscriminately under the same generative learning paradigm.This unification empowers LaVIT to serve as an impressive generalist interface to understand and generate multi-modal content simultaneously.Extensive experiments further showcase that it outperforms the existing models by a large margin on massive vision-language tasks.Our code and models will be available at https:",True,263889455,"""How does the LaVIT model use dynamic discrete visual tokenization to unify vision and language inputs for large language models?"",","""The paper 'Unified Language-Vision Pretraining in LLM with Dynamic Discrete Visual Tokenization' introduces LaVIT, which uses a visual tokenizer to convert images into sequences of discrete tokens.

What paper first extends rotary positional encoding (RoPE) for camera-geometry encoding in multi-view transformers?,GTA: A GEOMETRY-AWARE ATTENTION MECHANISM FOR MULTI-VIEW TRANSFORMERS,"As transformers are equivariant to the permutation of input tokens, encoding the positional information of tokens is necessary for many tasks.However, since existing positional encoding schemes have been initially designed for NLP tasks, their suitability for vision tasks, which typically exhibit different structural properties in their data, is questionable.We argue that existing positional encoding schemes are suboptimal for 3D vision tasks, as they do not respect their underlying 3D geometric structure.Based on this hypothesis, we propose a geometryaware attention mechanism that encodes the geometric structure of tokens as relative transformation determined by the geometric relationship between queries and key-value pairs.By evaluating on multiple novel view synthesis (NVS) datasets in the sparse wide-baseline multi-view setting, we show that our attention, called Geometric Transform Attention (GTA), improves learning efficiency and performance of state-of-the-art transformer-based NVS models without any additional learned parameters and only minor computational overhead.",True,264147054,"""How does the Geometric Transform Attention (GTA) mechanism proposed in 'GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers' improve transformer models' understanding of geometric structures in 3D vision tasks?"",","""In 'GTA: A Geometry-Aware Attention Mechanism for Multi-View Transformers', the Geometric Transform Attention (GTA) mechanism enhances the representation of 3D geometric structures by encoding them directly into the attention mechanism.

Which studies should I look into that have explored the task of factuality in abstractive summarization and proposed ways to detect hallucinated content in generated text?,On Faithfulness and Factuality in Abstractive Summarization,"It is well known that the standard likelihood training and approximate decoding objectives in neural text generation models lead to less human-like responses for open-ended tasks such as language modeling and story generation.

Is there any paper that combines causal inference and finetuning for language models?,Preserving Commonsense Knowledge from Pre-trained Language Models via Causal Inference,"Fine-tuning has been proven to be a simple and effective technique to transfer the learned knowledge of Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) to downstream tasks. However, vanilla fine-tuning easily overfits the target data and degrades the generalization ability. Most existing studies attribute it to catastrophic forgetting, and they retain the pre-trained knowledge indiscriminately without identifying what knowledge is transferable. Motivated by this, we frame fine-tuning into a causal graph and discover that the crux of catastrophic forgetting lies in the missing causal effects from the pretrained data. Based on the causal view, we propose a unified objective for fine-tuning to retrieve the causality back. Intriguingly, the unified objective can be seen as the sum of the vanilla fine-tuning objective, which learns new knowledge from target data, and the causal objective, which preserves old knowledge from PLMs. Therefore, our method is flexible and can mitigate negative transfer while preserving knowledge. Since endowing models with commonsense is a long-standing challenge, we implement our method on commonsense QA with a proposed heuristic estimation to verify its effectiveness.

Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning, i.e., predicting future video frames with a given language instruction and reference frames. It is a highly challenging task to ground task-level goals specified by instructions and high-fidelity frames together, requiring large-scale data and computation. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-to-image (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis.

How to better attract readers to news articles by generating personalized headlines?,Generating User-Engaging News Headlines,"The potential choices for news article headlines are enormous, and finding the right balance between conveying the essential message and capturing the reader's attention is key to effective headlining.

Is there a paper which applies Bayesian optimization to modular continual learning?,A Probabilistic Framework for Modular Continual Learning,"Modular approaches, which use a different composition of modules for each problem and avoid forgetting by design, have been shown to be a promising direction in continual learning (CL).

To address this challenge, we develop a modular CL framework, called PICLE, that accelerates search by using a probabilistic model to cheaply compute the fitness of each composition. The model combines prior knowledge about good module compositions with datasetspecific information. Its use is complemented by splitting up the search space into subsets, such as perceptual and latent subsets. We show that PICLE is the first modular CL algorithm to achieve different types of transfer while scaling to large search spaces.

Which paper employs a two-stage approach in generative models to tackle ABSA tasks across various domains?,Bidirectional Generative Framework for Cross-domain Aspect-based Sentiment Analysis,"Cross-domain aspect-based sentiment analysis (ABSA) aims to perform various fine-grained sentiment analysis tasks on a target domain by transferring knowledge from a source domain. Since labeled data only exists in the source domain, a model is expected to bridge the domain gap for tackling cross-domain ABSA. Though domain adaptation methods have proven to be effective, most of them are based on a discriminative model, which needs to be specifically designed for different ABSA tasks. To offer a more general solution, we propose a unified bidirectional generative framework to tackle various cross-domain ABSA tasks. Specifically, our framework trains a generative model in both text-to-label and label-to-text directions. The former transforms each task into a unified format to learn domain-agnostic features, and the latter generates natural sentences from noisy labels for data augmentation, with which a more accurate model can be trained. To investigate the effectiveness and generality of our framework, we conduct extensive experiments on four cross-domain ABSA tasks and present new state-of-the-art results on all tasks.

Could you suggest research that tries to interpret how bi-directional RNNs manage to carry out Named Entity Recognition (NER) tasks?,Interpretability Analysis for Named Entity Recognition to Understand System Predictions and How They Can Improve under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) license Computational Linguistics,"Named entity recognition systems achieve remarkable performance on domains such as English news. It is natural to ask: What are these models actually learning to achieve this? Are they merely memorizing the names themselves? Or are they capable of interpreting the text and inferring the correct entity type from the linguistic context? We examine these questions by contrasting the performance of several variants of architectures for named entity recognition, with some provided only representations of the context as features. We experiment with GloVebased BiLSTM-CRF as well as BERT. We find that context does influence predictions, but the main factor driving high performance is learning the named tokens themselves. Furthermore, we find that BERT is not always better at recognizing predictive contexts compared to a BiLSTM-CRF model. We enlist human annotators to evaluate the feasibility of inferring entity types from context alone and find that humans are also mostly unable to infer entity types for the majority of examples on which the context-only system made errors. However, there is room for improvement: A system should be able to recognize any named entity in a predictive context correctly Submission Volume 47, Number 1 and our experiments indicate that current systems may be improved by such capability. Our human study also revealed that systems and humans do not always learn the same contextual clues, and context-only systems are sometimes correct even when humans fail to recognize the entity type from the context. Finally, we find that one issue contributing to model errors is the use of ""entangled"" representations that encode both contextual and local token information into a single vector, which can obscure clues. Our results suggest that designing models that explicitly operate over representations of local inputs and context, respectively, may in some cases improve performance.

Find the NLP paper that focuses on dialogue generation and introduces advancements in the augmentation of one-to-many or one-to-one dialogue data by conducting augmentation within the semantic space.,DialoGPS: Dialogue Path Sampling in Continuous Semantic Space for Data Augmentation in Multi-Turn Conversations,"In open-domain dialogue generation tasks, contexts and responses in most datasets are one-to-one mapped, violating an important many-to-many characteristic: a context leads to various responses, and a response answers multiple contexts.

Could you recommend research that investigates the enhancement of neural passage retrieval through the application of dual encoders and the generation of synthetic questions?,Zero-shot Neural Passage Retrieval via Domain-targeted Synthetic Question Generation,"A major obstacle to the wide-spread adoption of neural retrieval models is that they require large supervised training sets to surpass traditional term-based techniques, which are constructed from raw corpora. In this paper, we propose an approach to zero-shot learning for passage retrieval that uses synthetic question generation to close this gap. The question generation system is trained on general domain data, but is applied to documents in the targeted domain. This allows us to create arbitrarily large, yet noisy, question-passage relevance pairs that are domain specific. Furthermore, when this is coupled with a simple hybrid termneural model, first-stage retrieval performance can be improved further. Empirically, we show that this is an effective strategy for building neural passage retrieval models in the absence of large training corpora. Depending on the domain, this technique can even approach the accuracy of supervised models.",True,231704318,"""How does the zero-shot neural passage retrieval approach using domain-targeted synthetic question generation improve retrieval performance without large training datasets?"",","""The paper 'Zero-shot Neural Passage Retrieval via Domain-targeted Synthetic Question Generation' describes a method that leverages synthetic question generation trained on general domain data and applies it to domain-specific documents.

Which vision-language model can demonstrate that visual grounding could facilitate efficient language acquisition? (OctoBERT),World-to-Words: Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition through Fast Mapping in Vision-Language Models,"The ability to connect language units to their referents in the physical world, referred to as grounding, is crucial to learning and understanding grounded meanings of words.

To this end, we introduce Grounded Open Vocabulary Acquisition (GOVA) to examine grounding and bootstrapping in openworld language learning. As an initial attempt, we propose World-to-Words (W2W), a novel visually-grounded language model by pre-training on image-text pairs highlighting grounding as an objective.

After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer.

What research should I explore to understand methods for matching word senses in contexts using embeddings without relying on external lexical resources?,Making Sense of Word Embeddings,"We present a simple yet effective approach for learning word sense embeddings. In contrast to existing techniques, which either directly learn sense representations from corpora or rely on sense inventories from lexical resources, our approach can induce a sense inventory from existing word embeddings via clustering of ego-networks of related words. An integrated WSD mechanism enables labeling of words in context with learned sense vectors, which gives rise to downstream applications. Experiments show that the performance of our method is comparable to state-of-the-art unsupervised WSD systems.Related WorkOur method learns multi-prototype word embeddings and applies them to WSD. Below we briefly review both strains of research.Multi-Prototype Word Vector SpacesIn his pioneering work, Schütze (1998) induced sparse sense vectors by clustering context vectors using the EM algorithm. This approach is fitted with a similarity-based WSD mechanism. Later, Reisinger and Mooney (2010) presented a multiprototype vector space. Sparse TF-IDF vectors are clustered using a parametric method fixing the same number of senses for all words. Sense vectors are centroids of the clusters.While most dense word vector models represent a word with a single vector and thus conflate senses(Mikolov et al., 2013;Pennington et al., 2014), there are several approaches that produce word sense embeddings.

Is there a paper that takes a mixed machine learning and solver based approach to code translation?,GUESS & SKETCH: LANGUAGE MODEL GUIDED TRANSPILATION,"Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours.Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze.Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question.Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts.Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space.Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs.Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness.In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code.Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods.GUESS & SKETCH extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output.We test GUESS & SKETCH on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler.We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",True,262828485,"""How does the GUESS & SKETCH approach improve the process of code transpilation for assembly code, and what are its primary components?"",","""The paper 'GUESS & SKETCH: LANGUAGE MODEL GUIDED TRANSPILATION' presents a neurosymbolic approach combining neural language models and symbolic solvers to improve assembly code transpilation.

Can we find the solution of the Bilevel optimization when the lower-level problem is nonconvex?,On Penalty Methods for Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization and First-Order Stochastic Approximation,"In this work, we study first-order algorithms for solving Bilevel Optimization (BO) where the objective functions are smooth but possibly nonconvex in both levels and the variables are restricted to closed convex sets. As a first step, we study the landscape of BO through the lens of penalty methods, in which the upper-and lower-level objectives are combined in a weighted sum with penalty parameter σ > 0. In particular, we establish a strong connection between the penalty function and the hyper-objective by explicitly characterizing the conditions under which the values and derivatives of the two must be O(σ)-close. A by-product of our analysis is the explicit formula for the gradient of hyper-objective when the lower-level problem has multiple solutions under minimal conditions, which could be of independent interest. Next, viewing the penalty formulation as O(σ)-approximation of the original BO, we propose firstorder algorithms that find an ϵ-stationary solution by optimizing the penalty formulation with σ = O(ϵ). When the perturbed lower-level problem uniformly satisfies the small-error proximal error-bound (EB) condition, we propose a first-order algorithm that converges to an ϵ-stationary point of the penalty function, using in total O(ϵ −3 ) and O(ϵ −7 ) accesses to first-order (stochastic) gradient oracles when the oracle is deterministic and oracles are noisy, respectively. Under an additional assumption on stochastic oracles, we show that the algorithm can be implemented in a fully single-loop manner, i.e., with O(1) samples per iteration, and achieves the improved oracle-complexity of O(ϵ −3 ) and O(ϵ −5 ), respectively.",True,261530996,"""How does the paper 'On Penalty Methods for Nonconvex Bilevel Optimization and First-Order Stochastic Approximation' address the challenges of finding solutions to nonconvex bilevel optimization problems using penalty methods?"",","""The paper proposes using penalty methods to tackle nonconvex bilevel optimization by combining upper and lower-level objectives into a weighted sum with a penalty parameter, σ.

We develop a two-branch neural network that is adaptive and explicit in the frequency domain.

Is there an evaluation metric for natural language generation that predicts the factual consistency score through a mean-max aggregation method?,ALIGNSCORE: Evaluating Factual Consistency with A Unified Alignment Function,"Many text generation applications require the generated text to be factually consistent with input information. Automatic evaluation of factual consistency is challenging.

In this paper, we propose ALIGNSCORE, a new holistic metric that applies to a variety of factual inconsistency scenarios as above. ALIGN-SCORE is based on a general function of information alignment between two arbitrary text pieces. Crucially, we develop a unified training framework of the alignment function by integrating a large diversity of data sources, resulting in 4.7M training examples from 7 well-established tasks (NLI, QA, paraphrasing, fact verification, information retrieval, semantic similarity, and summarization).

Which multimodal large language model represents visual data as the discrete tokens like text and training with the unified next-token prediction objective?,UNIFIED LANGUAGE-VISION PRETRAINING IN LLM WITH DYNAMIC DISCRETE VISUAL TOKENIZATION,"Recently, the remarkable advance of the Large Language Model (LLM) has inspired researchers to transfer its extraordinary reasoning capability to both vision and language data.

We compare several methods to infer boundaries, including end-to-end learning through stochastic re-parameterisation, supervised learning (based on segmentations from subword tokenizers or spikes in conditional entropy), as well as linguistically motivated boundaries. We perform character-level evaluation on texts from multiple datasets and morphologically diverse languages. The results demonstrate that dynamic pooling, which jointly segments and models language, is both faster and more accurate than vanilla Transformers and fixed-length pooling within the same computational budget.",True,253581399,"""How does the 'Efficient Transformers with Dynamic Token Pooling' paper address the inefficiency of fixed-length token pooling by learning dynamic sequence boundaries in language models?"",","""The paper 'Efficient Transformers with Dynamic Token Pooling' tackles inefficiency by introducing a dynamic-pooling mechanism in Transformers, predicting segment boundaries autoregressively.

Can you find a dataset that shows LLM-based evaluation may not be reliable enough?,EVALUATING LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS AT EVALUATING INSTRUCTION FOLLOWING,"As research in large language models (LLMs) continues to accelerate, LLM-based evaluation has emerged as a scalable and cost-effective alternative to human evaluations for comparing the ever increasing list of models. This paper investigates the efficacy of these ""LLM evaluators"", particularly in using them to assess instruction following, a metric that gauges how closely generated text adheres to the given instruction. We introduce a challenging meta-evaluation benchmark, LLM-BAR, designed to test the ability of an LLM evaluator in discerning instructionfollowing outputs. The authors manually curated 419 pairs of outputs, one adhering to instructions while the other diverging, yet may possess deceptive qualities that mislead an LLM evaluator, e.g., a more engaging tone. Contrary to existing meta-evaluation, we discover that different evaluators (i.e., combinations of LLMs and prompts) exhibit distinct performance on LLMBAR and even the highestscoring ones have substantial room for improvement. We also present a novel suite of prompting strategies that further close the gap between LLM and human evaluators.

Are there any papers that construct convolutional networks which are equivariant with respect to non-compact/non-abelian Lie groups?,LIE GROUP DECOMPOSITIONS FOR EQUIVARIANT NEURAL NETWORKS,"Invariance and equivariance to geometrical transformations have proven to be very useful inductive biases when training (convolutional) neural network models, especially in the low-data regime. Much work has focused on the case where the symmetry group employed is compact or abelian, or both. Recent work has explored enlarging the class of transformations used to the case of Lie groups, principally through the use of their Lie algebra, as well as the group exponential and logarithm maps. The applicability of such methods to larger transformation groups is limited by the fact that depending on the group of interest G, the exponential map may not be surjective. Further limitations are encountered when G is neither compact nor abelian. Using the structure and geometry of Lie groups and their homogeneous spaces, we present a framework by which it is possible to work with such groups primarily focusing on the Lie groups G = GL + (n, R) and G = SL(n, R), as well as their representation as affine transformations R n ⋊ G. Invariant integration as well as a global parametrization is realized by decomposing the 'larger' groups into subgroups and submanifolds which can be handled individually. Under this framework, we show how convolution kernels can be parametrized to build models equivariant with respect to affine transformations.

Could you suggest research that investigates enhancing zero-shot question answering with prompts from language models integrated with knowledge graph data?,Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Prompting for Zero-Shot Knowledge Graph Question Answering,"Large Language Models (LLMs) are capable of performing zero-shot closed-book question answering tasks, based on their internal knowledge stored in parameters during pre-training. However, such internalized knowledge might be insufficient and incorrect, which could lead LLMs to generate factually wrong answers. Furthermore, fine-tuning LLMs to update their knowledge is expensive. To this end, we propose to augment the knowledge directly in the input of LLMs. Specifically, we first retrieve the relevant facts to the input question from the knowledge graph based on semantic similarities between the question and its associated facts. After that, we prepend the retrieved facts to the input question in the form of the prompt, which is then forwarded to LLMs to generate the answer. Our framework, Knowledge-Augmented language model PromptING (KAP-ING), requires no model training, thus completely zero-shot. We validate the performance of our KAPING framework on the knowledge graph question answering task, that aims to answer the user's question based on facts over a knowledge graph, on which ours outperforms relevant zero-shot baselines by up to 48% in average, across multiple LLMs of various sizes.",True,260063238,"""How does the Knowledge-Augmented Language Model Prompting (KAP-ING) framework improve zero-shot question answering performance using knowledge graphs?"",","""The 'Knowledge-Augmented Language Model PromptING (KAP-ING)' framework enhances zero-shot question answering by retrieving relevant facts from a knowledge graph, based on semantic similarity with input questions.

Could you direct me to research that evaluates few-shot slot tagging model performance by averaging micro-F1 scores across different test episodes?,Inverse is Better!

These methods modify input samples with prompt sentence pieces, and decode label tokens to map samples to corresponding labels. However, such a paradigm is very inefficient for the task of slot tagging. Since slot tagging samples are multiple consecutive words in a sentence, the prompting methods have to enumerate all n-grams token spans to find all the possible slots, which greatly slows down the prediction. To tackle this, we introduce an inverse paradigm for prompting. Different from the classic prompts mapping tokens to labels, we reversely predict slot values given slot types. Such inverse prompting only requires a oneturn prediction for each slot type and greatly speeds up the prediction. Besides, we propose a novel Iterative Prediction Strategy, from which the model learns to refine predictions by considering the relations between different slot types.

Which work suggests that machine translation models might get too confident and generate coherent but inadequant translations?,Prevent the Language Model from being Overconfident in Neural Machine Translation,"The Neural Machine Translation (NMT) model is essentially a joint language model conditioned on both the source sentence and partial translation. Therefore, the NMT model naturally involves the mechanism of the Language Model (LM) that predicts the next token only based on partial translation. Despite its success, NMT still suffers from the hallucination problem, generating fluent but inadequate translations. The main reason is that NMT pays excessive attention to the partial translation while neglecting the source sentence to some extent, namely overconfidence of the LM. Accordingly, we define the Margin between the NMT and the LM, calculated by subtracting the predicted probability of the LM from that of the NMT model for each token. The Margin is negatively correlated to the overconfidence degree of the LM. Based on the property, we propose a Margin-based Token-level Objective (MTO) and a Margin-based Sentencelevel Objective (MSO) to maximize the Margin for preventing the LM from being overconfident.

Which paper first study POMDP with enhanced feedback on observations?,Sample-Efficient Learning of POMDPs with Multiple Observations In Hindsight,"This paper studies the sample-efficiency of learning in Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs), a challenging problem in reinforcement learning that is known to be exponentially hard in the worst-case. Motivated by real-world settings such as loading in game playing, we propose an enhanced feedback model called ""multiple observations in hindsight"", where after each episode of interaction with the POMDP, the learner may collect multiple additional observations emitted from the encountered latent states, but may not observe the latent states themselves. We show that sample-efficient learning under this feedback model is possible for two new subclasses of POMDPs: multi-observation revealing POMDPs and distinguishable POMDPs. Both subclasses generalize and substantially relax revealing POMDPs-a widely studied subclass for which sample-efficient learning is possible under standard trajectory feedback.

"Is there a dialogue dataset where a speaker's utterance is grounded in their persona, consisting of image-text pairs representing their episodic memories?",MPCHAT: Towards Multimodal Persona-Grounded Conversation,"In order to build self-consistent personalized dialogue agents, previous research has mostly focused on textual persona that delivers personal facts or personalities.

In this work, we extend persona-based dialogue to the multimodal domain and make two main contributions. First, we present the first multimodal persona-based dialogue dataset named MPCHAT, which extends persona with both text and images to contain episodic memories. Second, we empirically show that incorporating multimodal persona, as measured by three proposed multimodal persona-grounded dialogue tasks (i.e., next response prediction, grounding persona prediction, and speaker identification), leads to statistically significant performance improvements across all tasks.

Which knowledge graph completion method focuses on reducing memory usage by pruning features?,GreenKGC: A Lightweight Knowledge Graph Completion Method,"Knowledge graph completion (KGC) aims to discover missing relationships between entities in knowledge graphs (KGs).

GreenKGC consists of three modules: representation learning, feature pruning, and decision learning, to extract discriminant KG features and make accurate predictions on missing relationships using classifiers and negative sampling.

What paper provides generalization bounds for self supervised learning models eg.

Which paper introduce a DRO (distribution robust optimization) like training objective for doing adversarial training without constructing adversarial samples.,DSRM: Boost Textual Adversarial Training with Distribution Shift Risk Minimization,"Adversarial training is one of the bestperforming methods in improving the robustness of deep language models. However, robust models come at the cost of high time consumption, as they require multi-step gradient ascents or word substitutions to obtain adversarial samples. In addition, these generated samples are deficient in grammatical quality and semantic consistency, which impairs the effectiveness of adversarial training. To address these problems, we introduce a novel, effective procedure for instead adversarial training with only clean data. Our procedure, distribution shift risk minimization (DSRM), estimates the adversarial loss by perturbing the input data's probability distribution rather than their embeddings. This formulation results in a robust model that minimizes the expected global loss under adversarial attacks. Our approach requires zero adversarial samples for training and reduces time consumption by up to 70% compared to current best-performing adversarial training methods. Experiments demonstrate that DSRM considerably improves BERT's resistance to textual adversarial attacks and achieves state-of-the-art robust accuracy on various benchmarks.",True,259262427,"""How does Distribution Shift Risk Minimization (DSRM) improve robustness in textual adversarial training without using adversarial samples?"",","""The paper 'DSRM: Boost Textual Adversarial Training with Distribution Shift Risk Minimization' introduces DSRM, which enhances the robustness of language models like BERT by estimating adversarial loss through perturbing data distributions instead of generating adversarial samples.

In this paper, we analyze the complementary characteristics of both OoD detection methods and propose a multi-level knowledge distillation approach that integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. Specifically, we use a fine-tuned model as the teacher to teach a randomly initialized student model on the ID examples. Besides the prediction layer distillation, we present a similarity-based intermediate layer distillation method to thoroughly explore the representation space of the teacher model. In this way, the learned student can better represent the ID data manifold while gaining a stronger ability to map OoD examples outside the ID data manifold with the regularization inherited from pre-training. Besides, the student model sees only ID examples during parameter learning, further promoting more distinguishable features for OoD detection.

Are there any studies that explore post-hoc techniques for hallucination detection at both the token- and sentence-level in neural sequence generation tasks?,Evaluating the Factual Consistency of Abstractive Text Summarization,"The most common metrics for assessing summarization algorithms do not account for whether summaries are factually consistent with source documents.

The factual consistency model is then trained jointly for three tasks: 1) predict whether each summary sentence is factually consistent or not, 2) in either case, extract a span in the source document to support this consistency prediction, 3) for each summary sentence that is deemed inconsistent, extract the inconsistent span from it. Transferring this model to summaries generated by several neural models reveals that this highly scalable approach outperforms previous models, including those trained with strong supervision using datasets from related domains, such as natural language inference and fact checking.

What prior works suggested that exposure bias could lead to hallucinations in neural machine translation models?,Analyzing the Source and Target Contributions to Predictions in Neural Machine Translation,"In Neural Machine Translation (and, more generally, conditional language modeling), the generation of a target token is influenced by two types of context: the source and the prefix of the target sequence. While many attempts to understand the internal workings of NMT models have been made, none of them explicitly evaluates relative source and target contributions to a generation decision. We argue that this relative contribution can be evaluated by adopting a variant of Layerwise Relevance Propagation (LRP). Its underlying 'conservation principle' makes relevance propagation unique: differently from other methods, it evaluates not an abstract quantity reflecting token importance, but the proportion of each token's influence. We extend LRP to the Transformer and conduct an analysis of NMT models which explicitly evaluates the source and target relative contributions to the generation process. We analyze changes in these contributions when conditioning on different types of prefixes, when varying the training objective or the amount of training data, and during the training process. We find that models trained with more data tend to rely on source information more and to have more sharp token contributions; the training process is non-monotonic with several stages of different nature. 1",True,224818197,"""How does the paper 'Analyzing the Source and Target Contributions to Predictions in Neural Machine Translation' suggest that exposure bias contributes to hallucinations in neural machine translation models?"",","""The paper discusses how models with exposure bias tend to rely too heavily on target history, leading to hallucinations, where models generate fluent but inadequate translations.

"Could you suggest research that examines how well language models work with creole languages, particularly in relation to their effectiveness with Nigerian Pidgin, given its close linguistic relationship with English?",On Language Models for Creoles,"Creole languages such as Nigerian Pidgin English and Haitian Creole are under-resourced and largely ignored in the NLP literature. Creoles typically result from the fusion of a foreign language with multiple local languages, and what grammatical and lexical features are transferred to the creole is a complex process (Sessarego, 2020). While creoles are generally stable, the prominence of some features may be much stronger with certain demographics or in some linguistic situations(Winford, 1999;Patrick, 1999).

Which paper formally defines the problem of model selection in llm agent for multi-modal reasoning?,TOWARDS ROBUST MULTI-MODAL REASONING VIA MODEL SELECTION,"The reasoning capabilities of LLM (Large Language Model) are widely acknowledged in recent research, inspiring studies on tool learning and autonomous agents. LLM serves as the ""brain"" of agent, orchestrating multiple tools for collaborative multi-step task solving. Unlike methods invoking tools like calculators or weather APIs for straightforward tasks, multi-modal agents excel by integrating diverse AI models for complex challenges. However, current multi-modal agents neglect the significance of model selection: they primarily focus on the planning and execution phases, and will only invoke predefined task-specific models for each subtask, making the execution fragile. Meanwhile, other traditional model selection methods are either incompatible with or suboptimal for the multi-modal agent scenarios, due to ignorance of dependencies among subtasks arising by multi-step reasoning.

"Could you suggest research that investigates how neural language models' forecasts correlate with human linguistic processing, especially in terms of syntactic surprisal?","Syntactic Surprisal From Neural Models Predicts, But Underestimates, Human Processing Difficulty From Syntactic Ambiguities","Humans exhibit garden path effects: When reading sentences that are temporarily structurally ambiguous, they slow down when the structure is disambiguated in favor of the less preferred alternative. Surprisal theory(Hale, 2001;Levy, 2008), a prominent explanation of this finding, proposes that these slowdowns are due to the unpredictability of each of the words that occur in these sentences. Challenging this hypothesis, van Schijndel and Linzen (2021) find that estimates of the cost of word predictability derived from language models severely underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects. In this work, we consider whether this underestimation is due to the fact that humans weight syntactic factors in their predictions more highly than language models do. We propose a method for estimating syntactic predictability from a language model, allowing us to weigh the cost of lexical and syntactic predictability independently. We find that treating syntactic predictability independently from lexical predictability indeed results in larger estimates of garden path. At the same time, even when syntactic predictability is independently weighted, surprisal still greatly underestimate the magnitude of human garden path effects.

We refer to these labels as peer labels, from which the peer effects are originally utilized in our work to improve the classification performance. To fully explore the peer-label relationship, we develop a PeerHTC method. This method innovatively measures the latent relevancy of peer labels through several metrics and then encodes the relevancy with a Graph Convolutional Neural Network. We also propose a sample importance learning method to ameliorate the side effects raised by modelling the peer label relevancy. Our experiments on several standard datasets demonstrate the evidence of peer labels and the superiority of PeerHTC over other state-of-the-art HTC methods in terms of classification accuracy.",True,259370602,"""How does the PeerHTC method improve classification performance in hierarchical text classification by utilizing peer-label relationships?"",","""The paper 'Peer-Label Assisted Hierarchical Text Classification' introduces PeerHTC, a method that innovatively measures and encodes the latent relevancy of same-level 'peer' labels using Graph Convolutional Neural Networks (GCNs).

What paper evaluated the ability of visual few-shot learning models to do in-context learning?,CONTEXT-AWARE META-LEARNING,"Large Language Models like ChatGPT demonstrate a remarkable capacity to learn new concepts during inference without any fine-tuning. However, visual models trained to detect new objects during inference have been unable to replicate this ability, and instead either perform poorly or require meta-training and/or finetuning on similar objects. In this work, we propose a meta-learning algorithm that emulates Large Language Models by learning new visual concepts during inference without fine-tuning. Our approach leverages a frozen pre-trained feature extractor, and analogous to in-context learning, recasts meta-learning as sequence modeling over datapoints with known labels and a test datapoint with an unknown label.

This learning paradigm trains the Transformer encoder to extrapolate to new classes in the parameter-space of the model, enabling our approach to learn new visual concepts during inference without fine-tuning. Due to its capacity to learn visual information ""in-context"", we term our approach Context-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML).Our primary contribution is to develop a meta-learning algorithm for universal meta-learning: the capacity to learn any new visual concept during inference without fine-tuning or meta-training on related images. This challenging setting emulates the deployment of LLMs to real-time applications, and strong performance in this setting would unlock new applications of visual meta-learning. Our theoretical analysis shows that an ELMES is the encoding that minimizes the entropy of detecting classes within the support set, and therefore, does not need to be learned. Our empirical analysis highlights the importance of reformulating meta-learning as sequence modeling: considering the support set and query together enables the model to attend to specific visual features of images in the support set to classify the query. Finally, our empirical analysis indicates CAML is a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm. On a diverse set of 8 out of 11 meta-learning benchmarks-and without meta-training or fine-tuning-CAML outperforms or matches the performance of P>M>F (Hu et al., 2022), a state-of-the-art meta-learning algorithm that is meta-trained on each benchmark.",True,264172174,"""How does the Context-Aware Meta-Learning (CAML) algorithm enable visual models to learn new concepts during inference without fine-tuning?"",","""The paper 'Context-Aware Meta-Learning' describes CAML as a meta-learning algorithm that leverages a frozen pre-trained feature extractor and a novel sequence modeling approach.

How to faithfully and explicitly measure the helpfulness of human explanations to language models during finetuning and inference?,Are Human Explanations Always Helpful? Towards Objective Evaluation of Human Natural Language Explanations,"Human-annotated labels and explanations are critical for training explainable NLP models. However, unlike human-annotated labels whose quality is easier to calibrate (e.g., with a majority vote), human-crafted free-form explanations can be quite subjective. Before blindly using them as ground truth to train ML models, a vital question needs to be asked: How do we evaluate a human-annotated explanation's quality? In this paper, we build on the view that the quality of a human-annotated explanation can be measured based on its helpfulness (or impairment) to the ML models' performance for the desired NLP tasks for which the annotations were collected. In comparison to the commonly used Simulatability score, we define a new metric that can take into consideration of the helpfulness of an explanation for model performance at both fine-tuning and inference. With the help of a unified dataset format, we evaluated the proposed metric on five datasets (e.g., e-SNLI) against two model architectures (T5 and BART), and the results show that our proposed metric can objectively evaluate the quality of human-annotated explanations, while Simulatability falls short.",True,258546862,"""How does the Treu metric improve the evaluation of human-annotated explanations in NLP models compared to the Simulatability score?"",","""The paper 'Are Human Explanations Always Helpful?

Is there any paper that proposes a set of criteria to comprehensively evaluate generated conversations?,Modeling What-to-ask and How-to-ask for Answer-unaware Conversational Question Generation,"Conversational Question Generation (CQG) is a critical task for machines to assist humans in fulfilling their information needs through conversations. The task is generally cast into two different settings: answer-aware and answerunaware. While the former facilitates the models by exposing the expected answer, the latter is more realistic and receiving growing attentions recently. What-to-ask and how-to-ask are the two main challenges in the answerunaware setting. To address the first challenge, existing methods mainly select sequential sentences in context as the rationales. We argue that the conversation generated using such naive heuristics may not be natural enough as in reality, the interlocutors often talk about the relevant contents that are not necessarily sequential in context. Additionally, previous methods decide the type of question (boolean/span-based) to be generated implicitly. Modeling the question type explicitly is crucial in this (answer-unaware) setting, as the answer which hints the models to generate a boolean or span-based question, is unavailable. To this end, we present SG-CQG, a two-stage CQG framework. For the what-to-ask stage, a sentence is selected as the rationale from a semantic graph that we construct, and extract the answer span from it. For the how-to-ask stage, a classifier determines the target answer type of the question via two explicit control signals before generating and filtering.

Could you recommend research that investigates how to use data augmentation for improving logical reasoning over text?,MERIt: Meta-Path Guided Contrastive Learning for Logical Reasoning,"Logical reasoning is of vital importance to natural language understanding.

Could you suggest research that examines the difficulties in employing weakly labeled datasets for named entity recognition and offers techniques to mitigate the associated data noise?,Named Entity Recognition with Small Strongly Labeled and Large Weakly Labeled Data,"Weak supervision has shown promising results in many natural language processing tasks, such as Named Entity Recognition (NER). Existing work mainly focuses on learning deep NER models only with weak supervision, i.e., without any human annotation, and shows that by merely using weakly labeled data, one can achieve good performance, though still underperforms fully supervised NER with manually/strongly labeled data. In this paper, we consider a more practical scenario, where we have both a small amount of strongly labeled data and a large amount of weakly labeled data. Unfortunately, we observe that weakly labeled data does not necessarily improve, or even deteriorate the model performance (due to the extensive noise in the weak labels) when we train deep NER models over a simple or weighted combination of the strongly labeled and weakly labeled data.

Therefore, the question naturally arises whether PTMs contain sufficient syntactic information for ABSA so that we can obtain a good ABSA model only based on PTMs. In this paper, we firstly compare the induced trees from PTMs and the dependency parsing trees on several popular models for the ABSA task, showing that the induced tree from finetuned RoBERTa (FT-RoBERTa) outperforms the parser-provided tree. The further analysis experiments reveal that the FT-RoBERTa Induced Tree is more sentiment-word-oriented and could benefit the ABSA task. The experiments also show that the pure RoBERTa-based model can outperform or approximate to the previous SOTA performances on six datasets across four languages since it implicitly incorporates the task-oriented syntactic information.",True,233209848,"""How does fine-tuning RoBERTa impact its ability to incorporate syntactic structures for Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA)?"",","""The paper titled 'Does syntax matter?

Could you suggest research that investigates improving retrieval-based conversational systems using by combining masked language modeling and relevance classification objectives?,Fine-grained Post-training for Improving Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems,"Retrieval-based dialogue systems display an outstanding performance when pre-trained language models are used, which includes bidirectional encoder representations from transformers (BERT). During the multi-turn response selection, BERT focuses on training the relationship between the context with multiple utterances and the response. However, this method of training is insufficient when considering the relations between each utterance in the context. This leads to a problem of not completely understanding the context flow that is required to select a response. To address this issue, we propose a new fine-grained post-training method that reflects the characteristics of the multi-turn dialogue. Specifically, the model learns the utterance level interactions by training every short context-response pair in a dialogue session. Furthermore, by using a new training objective, the utterance relevance classification, the model understands the semantic relevance and coherence between the dialogue utterances. Experimental results show that our model achieves new state-of-the-art with significant margins on three benchmark datasets. This suggests that the fine-grained post-training method is highly effective for the response selection task. 1",True,235097662,"""How does the fine-grained post-training method improve multi-turn dialogue response selection in retrieval-based systems?"",","""The paper 'Fine-grained Post-training for Improving Retrieval-based Dialogue Systems' presents a new method that enhances response selection by teaching utterance-level interactions and semantic coherence.

Has there been any work that improves the work on integrated gradients by leveraging interpolation strategies to improve gradient accuracies?,Discretized Integrated Gradients for Explaining Language Models,"As a prominent attribution-based explanation algorithm, Integrated Gradients (IG) is widely adopted due to its desirable explanation axioms and the ease of gradient computation. It measures feature importance by averaging the model's output gradient interpolated along a straight-line path in the input data space. However, such straight-line interpolated points are not representative of text data due to the inherent discreteness of the word embedding space. This questions the faithfulness of the gradients computed at the interpolated points and consequently, the quality of the generated explanations. Here we propose Discretized Integrated Gradients (DIG), which allows effective attribution along non-linear interpolation paths. We develop two interpolation strategies for the discrete word embedding space that generates interpolation points that lie close to actual words in the embedding space, yielding more faithful gradient computation.

Which paper contains quantitative results demonstrating taking VQ tokens as inputs is inferior to pixel images for dense recognition tasks?,ADDP: Learning General Representations for Image Recognition and Generation with Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process,"Image recognition and generation have long been developed independently of each other. With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation learning, the development of general representations for both recognition and generation tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus on generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These methods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading recognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1) pixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as reconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations motivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that integrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework. In each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ tokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion process gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training samples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse high-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on recognition tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional generation, ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20k segmentation. Importantly, our method represents the first successful development of general representations applicable to both generation and dense recognition tasks.

Could you direct me to studies investigating the enhancement of bi-encoder text matching performance through the application of knowledge distillation methods?,VIRT: Improving Representation-based Text Matching via Virtual Interaction,"Text matching is a fundamental research problem in natural language understanding. Interaction-based approaches treat the text pair as a single sequence and encode it through cross encoders, while representation-based models encode the text pair independently with siamese or dual encoders. Interactionbased models require dense computations and thus are impractical in real-world applications. Representation-based models have become the mainstream paradigm for efficient text matching. However, these models suffer from severe performance degradation due to the lack of interactions between the pair of texts. To remedy this, we propose a Virtual InteRacTion mechanism (VIRT) for improving representation-based text matching while maintaining its efficiency. In particular, we introduce an interactive knowledge distillation module that is only applied during training. It enables deep interaction between texts by effectively transferring knowledge from the interaction-based model. A light interaction strategy is designed to fully leverage the learned interactive knowledge.

Could you suggest research that examines how well prompt tuning using soft embeddings works for utilizing pretrained language models in downstream applications with minimal finetuning?,The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning,"In this work, we explore ""prompt tuning,"" a simple yet effective mechanism for learning ""soft prompts"" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ""prefix tuning"" of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches.

What techniques have been investigated to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis by fusing different modalities?,Multimodal Sentiment Detection Based on Multi-channel Graph Neural Networks,"With the popularity of smartphones, we have witnessed the rapid proliferation of multimodal posts on various social media platforms.

In this work, we propose a simple yet highly accurate approximation for vanilla attention. We process the queries in chunks, and for each query, compute the top-k scores with respect to the keys.

What limitations do large language models have in evaluating information-seeking question answering?,Evaluating Open-Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models,"Lexical matching remains the de facto evaluation method for open-domain question answering (QA).

Without accurate evaluation, the true progress in open-domain QA remains unknown. In this paper, we conduct a thorough analysis of various open-domain QA models, including LLMs, by manually evaluating their answers on a subset of NQ-OPEN, a popular benchmark.

Finally, we demonstrate that automated evaluation models are a reasonable surrogate for lexical matching in some circumstances, but not for long-form answers generated by LLMs. The automated models struggle in detecting hallucinations in LLM answers and are thus unable to evaluate LLMs. At this time, there appears to be no substitute for human evaluation.",True,258615193,"""What are the challenges large language models face in evaluating open-domain question answering, according to the paper 'Evaluating Open-Domain Question Answering in the Era of Large Language Models'?"",","""The paper highlights that large language models (LLMs) struggle with the current lexical matching evaluation methods, which do not account for semantically equivalent answers that differ lexically.

Is there any paper that tries to investigate LLMs’ capabilities in solving elliptical constructions by using a test-dataset based on the psycolinguistic notion of Thematic Fit?,"We Understand Elliptical Sentences, and Language Models Should Too: A New Dataset for Studying Ellipsis and its Interaction with Thematic Fit","Ellipsis is a linguistic phenomenon characterized by the omission of one or more sentence elements. Solving such a linguistic construction is not a trivial issue in natural language processing since it involves the retrieval of non-overtly expressed verbal material, which might in turn require the model to integrate human-like syntactic and semantic knowledge. In this paper, we explored the issue of how the prototypicality of event participants affects the ability of Language Models (LMs) to handle elliptical sentences, and to identify the omitted arguments at different degrees of thematic fit, ranging from highly typical participants to semantically anomalous ones. With this purpose in mind, we built ELLie, the first dataset composed entirely of utterances containing different types of elliptical constructions, and structurally suited for evaluating the effect of argument thematic fit in solving ellipsis and reconstructing the missing element. Our tests demonstrated that the probability scores assigned by the models are higher for typical events than for atypical and impossible ones in different elliptical contexts, confirming the influence of prototypicality of the event participants in interpreting such linguistic structures. Finally, we conducted a retrieval task of the elided verb in the sentence in which the low performance of LMs highlighted a considerable difficulty in reconstructing the correct event.",True,259370867,"""How do the typicality of event participants and thematic fit affect the ability of language models to solve elliptical constructions, according to the study conducted in the 'ELLie' dataset?"",","""The paper 'We Understand Elliptical Sentences, and Language Models Should Too' demonstrates that language models assign higher probability scores to typical events compared to atypical or semantically anomalous ones in elliptical contexts.

Could you recommend a study that investigates the use of trainable prompts to enhance the parameter optimization process in machine learning models?,The Power of Scale for Parameter-Efficient Prompt Tuning,"In this work, we explore ""prompt tuning,"" a simple yet effective mechanism for learning ""soft prompts"" to condition frozen language models to perform specific downstream tasks. Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden.

Which paper utilizes language models to generate singable lyrics that can go well with a predefined melody?,Unsupervised Melody-to-Lyric Generation,"Automatic melody-to-lyric generation is a task in which song lyrics are generated to go with a given melody. It is of significant practical interest and more challenging than unconstrained lyric generation as the music imposes additional constraints onto the lyrics.

What techniques have been investigated to enhance multimodal sentiment analysis by fusing different modalities?,Improving Multimodal Fusion with Hierarchical Mutual Information Maximization for Multimodal Sentiment Analysis,"In multimodal sentiment analysis (MSA), the performance of a model highly depends on the quality of synthesized embeddings.

In this work, we propose a framework named MultiModal InfoMax (MMIM), which hierarchically maximizes the Mutual Information (MI) in unimodal input pairs (inter-modality) and between multimodal fusion result and unimodal input in order to maintain taskrelated information through multimodal fusion. The framework is jointly trained with the main task (MSA) to improve the performance of the downstream MSA task. To address the intractable issue of MI bounds, we further formulate a set of computationally simple parametric and non-parametric methods to approximate their truth value.

Is there any paper that explores ways to parameterize neural networks as proximal operators?,What's in a Prior?

Is there any paper that performs adversarial training on frame level for audio-visual representation learning?,MIR-GAN: Refining Frame-Level Modality-Invariant Representations with Adversarial Network for Audio-Visual Speech Recognition,"Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) attracts a surge of research interest recently by leveraging multimodal signals to understand human speech. Mainstream approaches addressing this task have developed sophisticated architectures and techniques for multi-modality fusion and representation learning. However, the natural heterogeneity of different modalities causes distribution gap between their representations, making it challenging to fuse them. In this paper, we aim to learn the shared representations across modalities to bridge their gap. Different from existing similar methods on other multimodal tasks like sentiment analysis, we focus on the temporal contextual dependencies considering the sequence-to-sequence task setting of AVSR. In particular, we propose an adversarial network to refine framelevel modality-invariant representations (MIR-GAN), which captures the commonality across modalities to ease the subsequent multimodal fusion process.

Which paper presents an easy to implement and high performing method for OOD detection with language models?,Is Fine-tuning Needed?

Could you direct me to studies investigating the enhancement of bi-encoder text matching performance through the application of knowledge distillation methods?,VIRT: Improving Representation-based Text Matching via Virtual Interaction,"Text matching is a fundamental research problem in natural language understanding. Interaction-based approaches treat the text pair as a single sequence and encode it through cross encoders, while representation-based models encode the text pair independently with siamese or dual encoders. Interactionbased models require dense computations and thus are impractical in real-world applications. Representation-based models have become the mainstream paradigm for efficient text matching.

This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models' (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GENSIM, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%. 1 , et al.

However, the amount of support required depends on the generality of a conclusion, the nature of the individual premises, and similar. An argument whose premises make its conclusion rationally worthy to be drawn is called sufficient in argument quality research. Previous work tackled sufficiency assessment as a standard text classification problem, not modeling the inherent relation of premises and conclusion. In this paper, we hypothesize that the conclusion of a sufficient argument can be generated from its premises. To study this hypothesis, we explore the potential of assessing sufficiency based on the output of large-scale pre-trained language models.

Building on recent work by(Wang et al., 2015), the interpretable logical forms, which are structured objects obeying certain constraints, are enumerated by an underlying grammar and are paired with their canonical realizations. In order to use sequence prediction, we need to sequentialize these logical forms. We compare three sequentializations: a direct linearization of the logical form, a linearization of the associated canonical realization, and a sequence consisting of derivation steps relative to the underlying grammar. We also show how grammatical constraints on the derivation sequence can easily be integrated inside the RNNbased sequential predictor. Our experiments show important improvements over previous results for the same dataset, and also demonstrate the advantage of incorporating the grammatical constraints.",True,16911296,"""How does the paper 'Sequence-based Structured Prediction for Semantic Parsing' propose using sequence prediction models with grammatical constraints to improve semantic parsing accuracy?"",","""In 'Sequence-based Structured Prediction for Semantic Parsing,' the authors propose using recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to map natural language questions into logical forms via sequential prediction.

What research exists on employing generative models with latent variable to capture semantic dependencies in conversational systems?,GTM: A Generative Triple-Wise Model for Conversational Question Generation,"Generating some appealing questions in opendomain conversations is an effective way to improve human-machine interactions and lead the topic to a broader or deeper direction.

Which paper enables interactive semantic parsing by training an error correction model with simulated human feedback instead of human annotations?,Learning to Simulate Natural Language Feedback for Interactive Semantic Parsing,"Interactive semantic parsing based on natural language (NL) feedback, where users provide feedback to correct the parser mistakes, has emerged as a more practical scenario than the traditional one-shot semantic parsing.

We show that vector arithmetic can be used for unsupervised sentiment transfer on the Yelp sentiment benchmark, with performance comparable to models tailored to this task. We find that distances between steering vectors reflect sentence similarity when evaluated on a textual similarity benchmark (STS-B), outperforming pooled hidden states of models.

Assessing the Factuality Degree of Events in Text,"Identifying the veracity, or factuality, of event mentions in text is fundamental for reasoning about eventualities in discourse. Inferences derived from events judged as not having happened, or as being only possible, are different from those derived from events evaluated as factual. Event factuality involves two separate levels of information. On the one hand, it deals with polarity, which distinguishes between positive and negative instantiations of events. On the other, it has to do with degrees of certainty (e.g., possible, probable), an information level generally subsumed under the category of epistemic modality. This article aims at contributing to a better understanding of how event factuality is articulated in natural language. For that purpose, we put forward a linguistic-oriented computational model which has at its core an algorithm articulating the effect of factuality relations across levels of syntactic embedding. As a proof of concept, this model has been implemented in De Facto, a factuality profiler for eventualities mentioned in text, and tested against a corpus built specifically for the task, yielding an F 1 of 0.70 (macro-averaging) and 0.80 (micro-averaging).

Is there any paper exploring real speakers and thus performing multimodal emotion recognition task?,A Facial Expression-Aware Multimodal Multi-task Learning Framework for Emotion Recognition in Multi-party Conversations,"Multimodal Emotion Recognition inMultiparty Conversations (MERMC)has recently attracted considerable attention. Due to the complexity of visual scenes in multi-party conversations, most previous MERMC studies mainly focus on text and audio modalities while ignoring visual information. Recently, several works proposed to extract face sequences as visual features and have shown the importance of visual information in MERMC. However, given an utterance, the face sequence extracted by previous methods may contain multiple people's faces, which will inevitably introduce noise to the emotion prediction of the real speaker.

How to achieve zero-shot lip reading?,OpenSR: Open-Modality Speech Recognition via Maintaining Multi-Modality Alignment,"Speech Recognition builds a bridge between the multimedia streaming (audio-only, visualonly or audio-visual) and the corresponding text transcription. However, when training the specific model of new domain, it often gets stuck in the lack of new-domain utterances, especially the labeled visual utterances. To break through this restriction, we attempt to achieve zero-shot modality transfer by maintaining the multi-modality alignment in phoneme space learned with unlabeled multimedia utterances in the high resource domain during the pretraining(Shi et al., 2022), and propose a training system Open-modality Speech Recognition (OpenSR) that enables the models trained on a single modality (e.g., audio-only) applicable to more modalities (e.g., visual-only and audio-visual). Furthermore, we employ a cluster-based prompt tuning strategy to handle the domain shift for the scenarios with only common words in the new domain utterances. We demonstrate that OpenSR enables modality transfer from one to any in three different settings (zero-, few-and fullshot), and achieves highly competitive zeroshot performance compared to the existing fewshot and full-shot lip-reading methods. To the best of our knowledge, OpenSR achieves the state-of-the-art performance of word error rate in LRS2 on audio-visual speech recognition and lip-reading with 2.7% and 25.0%, respectively.

What research has been conducted on applying contrastive techniques to distinguish normal from abnormal imagery for the creation of radiology reports?,Contrastive Attention for Automatic Chest X-ray Report Generation,"Recently, chest X-ray report generation, which aims to automatically generate descriptions of given chest X-ray images, has received growing research interests. The key challenge of chest X-ray report generation is to accurately capture and describe the abnormal regions. In most cases, the normal regions dominate the entire chest X-ray image, and the corresponding descriptions of these normal regions dominate the final report. Due to such data bias, learning-based models may fail to attend to abnormal regions. In this work, to effectively capture and describe abnormal regions, we propose the Contrastive Attention (CA) model. Instead of solely focusing on the current input image, the CA model compares the current input image with normal images to distill the contrastive information. The acquired contrastive information can better represent the visual features of abnormal regions. According to the experiments on the public IU-X-ray and MIMIC-CXR datasets, incorporating our CA into several existing models can boost their performance across most metrics. In addition, according to the analysis, the CA model can help existing models better attend to the abnormal regions and provide more accurate descriptions which are crucial for an interpretable diagnosis.

Which paper has conducted a thorough analysis of how language models of different architectures generate text that either aligns with or deviates from the properties of natural human language?,Language Model Evaluation Beyond Perplexity,"We propose an alternate approach to quantifying how well language models learn natural language: we ask how well they match the statistical tendencies of natural language. To answer this question, we analyze whether text generated from language models exhibits the statistical tendencies present in the humangenerated text on which they were trained. We provide a framework-paired with significance tests-for evaluating the fit of language models to these trends. We find that neural language models appear to learn only a subset of the tendencies considered, but align much more closely with empirical trends than proposed theoretical distributions (when present). Further, the fit to different distributions is highly-dependent on both model architecture and generation strategy.

Where can I find research about automatic evaluation metrics in summarization tasks disagree with each other?,Metrics also Disagree in the Low Scoring Range: Revisiting Summarization Evaluation Metrics,"In text summarization, evaluating the efficacy of automatic metrics without human judgments has become recently popular.

Which paper first used language models to emulate tool executions for studying the risks of language model agents?,Identifying the Risks of LM Agents with an LM-Emulated Sandbox,"Recent advances in Language Model (LM) agents and tool use, exemplified by applications like ChatGPT Plugins, enable a rich set of capabilities but also amplify potential risks-such as leaking private data or causing financial losses. Identifying these risks is labor-intensive, necessitating implementing the tools, setting up the environment for each test scenario manually, and finding risky cases. As tools and agents become more complex, the high cost of testing these agents will make it increasingly difficult to find high-stakes, long-tail risks. To address these challenges, we introduce ToolEmu: a framework that uses a LM to emulate tool execution and enables scalable testing of LM agents against a diverse range of tools and scenarios. Alongside the emulator, we develop an LM-based automatic safety evaluator that examines agent failures and quantifies associated risks. We test both the tool emulator and evaluator through human evaluation and find that 68.8% of failures identified with ToolEmu would be valid real-world agent failures. Using our curated initial benchmark consisting of 36 high-stakes tools and 144 test cases, we provide a quantitative risk analysis of current LM agents and identify numerous failures with potentially severe outcomes. Notably, even the safest LM agent exhibits such failures 23.9% of the time according to our evaluator, underscoring the need to develop safer LM agents for real-world deployment. 1 * Equal contribution.

Which backdoor paper first used the CLIP to suppress benign features and enhance poisoning features to design triggers?,Efficient Backdoor Attacks for Deep Neural Networks in Real-world Scenarios,"Recent deep neural networks (DNNs) have come to rely on vast amounts of training data, providing an opportunity for malicious attackers to exploit and contaminate the data to carry out backdoor attacks. These attacks significantly undermine the reliability of DNNs. However, existing backdoor attack methods make unrealistic assumptions, assuming that all training data comes from a single source and that attackers have full access to the training data. In this paper, we address this limitation by introducing a more realistic attack scenario where victims collect data from multiple sources, and attackers cannot access the complete training data. We refer to this scenario as data-constrained backdoor attacks. In such cases, previous attack methods suffer from severe efficiency degradation due to the entanglement between benign and poisoning features during the backdoor injection process.IntroductionDeep neural networks (DNNs) are widely utilized and powerful machine learning algorithms inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain.

We develop an evaluation paradigm that enables us to disentangle these two types of errors in naturally occurring textual contexts. We find that factuality and congruity are often at odds, and that models specifically struggle with accurate descriptions of entities that are less familiar to people.

Which paper proposed a learning-based data augmentation method for improving compositional generalization of language models?,Learning to Substitute Spans towards Improving Compositional Generalization,"Despite the rising prevalence of neural sequence models, recent empirical evidences suggest their deficiency in compositional generalization.

Could you recommend a study that investigates guiding abstractive summarization through assessing sentence informativeness?,Salience Allocation as Guidance for Abstractive Summarization,"Abstractive summarization models typically learn to capture the salient information from scratch implicitly. Recent literature adds extractive summaries as guidance for abstractive summarization models to provide hints of salient content and achieves better performance. However, extractive summaries as guidance could be over strict, leading to information loss or noisy signals. Furthermore, it cannot easily adapt to documents with various abstractiveness. As the number and allocation of salience content pieces vary, it is hard to find a fixed threshold deciding which content should be included in the guidance. In this paper, we propose a novel summarization approach with a flexible and reliable salience guidance, namely SEASON (SaliencE Allocation as Guidance for Abstractive SummarizatiON). SEASON utilizes the allocation of salience expectation to guide abstractive summarization and adapts well to articles in different abstractiveness.

"Could you recommend research that investigates techniques for creating counterfactual examples to enhance question-answering systems, such as training a T5 model augmented with retrieval?",Retrieval-guided Counterfactual Generation for QA,"Deep NLP models have been shown to be brittle to input perturbations. Recent work has shown that data augmentation using counterfactuals -i.e. minimally perturbed inputscan help ameliorate this weakness. We focus on the task of creating counterfactuals for question answering, which presents unique challenges related to world knowledge, semantic diversity, and answerability. To address these challenges, we develop a Retrieve-Generate-Filter (RGF) technique to create counterfactual evaluation and training data with minimal human supervision. Using an open-domain QA framework and question generation model trained on original task data, we create counterfactuals that are fluent, semantically diverse, and automatically labeled. Data augmentation with RGF counterfactuals improves performance on out-of-domain and challenging evaluation sets over and above existing methods, in both the reading comprehension and open-domain QA settings.

What research has been conducted on determining the ideal segment length for unsupervised keyphrase extraction?,Unsupervised Keyphrase Extraction by Jointly Modeling Local and Global Context,"Embedding based methods are widely used for unsupervised keyphrase extraction (UKE) tasks. Generally, these methods simply calculate similarities between phrase embeddings and document embedding, which is insufficient to capture different context for a more effective UKE model. In this paper, we propose a novel method for UKE, where local and global contexts are jointly modeled. From a global view, we calculate the similarity between a certain phrase and the whole document in the vector space as transitional embedding based models do. In terms of the local view, we first build a graph structure based on the document where phrases are regarded as vertices and the edges are similarities between vertices. Then, we proposed a new centrality computation method to capture local salient information based on the graph structure. Finally, we further combine the modeling of global and local context for ranking. We evaluate our models on three public benchmarks (Inspec, DUC 2001, SemEval 2010 and compare with existing state-of-the-art models. The results show that our model outperforms most models while generalizing better on input documents with different domains and length.

Is there a theory paper that explains why sometimes tuning momentum does not boost performance for training a neural network?,The Marginal Value of Momentum for Small Learning Rate SGD,"Momentum is known to accelerate the convergence of gradient descent in strongly convex settings without stochastic gradient noise.

Theoretical results in this paper clarify the role of momentum in stochastic settings where the learning rate is small and gradient noise is the dominant source of instability, suggesting that SGD with and without momentum behave similarly in the short and long time horizons.

What research has been conducted on incorporating visual data into the text summarization process?,Summary-Oriented Vision Modeling for Multimodal Abstractive Summarization,"Multimodal abstractive summarization (MAS) aims to produce a concise summary given the multimodal data (text and vision).

Is there a paper which proposes a general data selection method based on information theory?,GIO: GRADIENT INFORMATION OPTIMIZATION FOR TRAINING DATASET SELECTION,"It is often advantageous to train models on a subset of the available train examples, because the examples are of variable quality or because one would like to train with fewer examples, without sacrificing performance. We present Gradient Information Optimization (GIO), a scalable, task-agnostic approach to this data selection problem that requires only a small set of (unlabeled) examples representing a target distribution. GIO begins from a natural, information-theoretic objective that is intractable in practice. Our contribution is in showing that it can be made highly scalable through a simple relaxation of the objective and a highly efficient implementation. In experiments with machine translation, spelling correction, and image recognition, we show that GIO delivers outstanding results with very small train sets. These findings are robust to different representation models and hyperparameters for GIO itself. GIO is task-and domain-agnostic and can be applied out-of-the-box to new datasets and domains.Active learning. Active learning methods (e.g. Sener and Savarese, 2018; Gal et al., 2017; Kirsch  et al., 2019)  can be cast as data selection methods in our sense. In active learning, one iteratively chooses new unlabeled training examples to label, with the goal of efficiently creating a powerful train set. By contrast, GIO makes no use of labels and is oriented towards the goal of identifying a subset of existing cases to use for training. Additionally, active learning is most suited to classification problems, whereas GIO works with any arbitrary task.Heuristic. GIO is closer to recent methods in which one uses a large language model to generate a large number of candidate texts and then extracts a subset of them based on a specific criteria. For example, Brown et al. (2020) develop a heuristic method to filter CommonCrawl based on a trained classifier's probability that datapoints are high quality. Similarly, Wenzek et al. (2020) develop a pipeline to clean CommonCrawl based principally on the perplexity of an LM trained on high quality text, and Xie et al. (2023) develop a sampling technique based on approximate n-gram counts.Like GIO, these heuristic methods aim to select a subset of data that is higher quality and more relevant. However, they are either highly tailored to their particular tasks or they require very large numbers of examples (to develop classifiers or construct target probabilities). By contrast, GIO is task-and domain-agnostic, it can be applied plug-and-play to a new task and dataset, and it requires comparatively few gold examples X to serve as the target distribution.Similarity Search. Methods using vector or n-gram similarity search can also be used for data selection at scale (e.g. Johnson et al., 2017;Bernhardsson, 2017;Santhanam et al., 2022). The technique would index G and X and retrieve the top-k datapoints from G for each point in X. Like our method, similarity search works in a continuous space. However, similarity search can be prone to selecting suboptimal points; we review such a case in detail in Section 3.4. Additionally, similarity search does not have a natural stopping criterion and requires data size to be chosen arbitrarily. Is 10% data enough? 20%? We don't know a priori. And if the data in G is far away from X, similarity search will still choose it up to the desired data size. Recently, Yao et al. (2022) use a BM25 retrieval method for data selection, with strong results. However, BM25 operates on a bag-of-words model, which can make it challenging when the target set is small, and like any similarity search, requires data size to be chosen arbitrarily beforehand. Further, this method only applies to text tasks, whereas GIO applies to any task with continuous representation.",True,259203325,"""How does the Gradient Information Optimization (GIO) method improve dataset selection for training models across various tasks and domains?"",","""The paper 'GIO: Gradient Information Optimization for Training Dataset Selection' introduces GIO, a scalable, task-and-domain-agnostic method using an information-theoretic approach to optimize dataset selection.

Our experiments show that the learned patterns are human-interpretable, and that lower layers tend to capture shallow patterns, while upper layers learn more semantic ones. The values complement the keys' input patterns by inducing output distributions that concentrate probability mass on tokens likely to appear immediately after each pattern, particularly in the upper layers.

Unlike the discrete text prompts used by GPT-3, soft prompts are learned through backpropagation and can be tuned to incorporate signals from any number of labeled examples. Our end-to-end learned approach outperforms GPT-3's few-shot learning by a large margin. More remarkably, through ablations on model size using T5, we show that prompt tuning becomes more competitive with scale: as models exceed billions of parameters, our method ""closes the gap"" and matches the strong performance of model tuning (where all model weights are tuned). This finding is especially relevant because large models are costly to share and serve and the ability to reuse one frozen model for multiple downstream tasks can ease this burden. Our method can be seen as a simplification of the recently proposed ""prefix tuning"" of Li and Liang (2021) and we provide a comparison to this and other similar approaches.

Is there any paper that theoretically explains why in-context reinforcement learning works?,Transformers as Decision Makers: Provable In-Context Reinforcement Learning via Supervised Pretraining,"Large transformer models pretrained on offline reinforcement learning datasets have demonstrated remarkable in-context reinforcement learning (ICRL) capabilities, where they can make good decisions when prompted with interaction trajectories from unseen environments. However, when and how transformers can be trained to perform ICRL have not been theoretically well-understood. In particular, it is unclear which reinforcement-learning algorithms transformers can perform in context, and how distribution mismatch in offline training data affects the learned algorithms. This paper provides a theoretical framework that analyzes supervised pretraining for ICRL. This includes two recently proposed training methods -algorithm distillation and decision-pretrained transformers. First, assuming model realizability, we prove the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory. The generalization error will scale with model capacity and a distribution divergence factor between the expert and offline algorithms. Second, we show transformers with ReLU attention can efficiently approximate near-optimal online reinforcement learning algorithms like LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes. This provides the first quantitative analysis of the ICRL capabilities of transformers pretrained from offline trajectories. an online RL algorithm; and (3) when can supervised pretraining find such a good transformer. Specifically, this paper investigates the following open question:How can supervised pretraining on Transformers learn in-context reinforcement learning?In this paper, we initiate a theoretical study of the ICRL capability of transformers under supervised pretraining to address the open questions outlined above. We show that (1) Transformers can implement prevalent RL algorithms, including LinUCB and Thompson sampling for stochastic linear bandits, and UCB-VI for tabular Markov decision processes; (2) The algorithms learned by transformers achieve near-optimal regret bounds in their respective settings; (3) Supervised pretraining find such algorithms as long as the sample size scales with the covering number of transformer class and distribution ratio between expert and offline algorithms.Summary of contributions and paper outline• We propose a general framework for supervised pretraining approaches to meta-reinforcement learning (Section 2). This framework encompasses existing methods like Algorithm Distillation (Laskin et al.,  2022), where the expert and context algorithms are identical, as well as Decision-Pretrained Transformers (Lee et al., 2023), where the expert generates optimal actions for the MDP. It also includes approximate DPT variants where the expert estimates optimal actions from full interaction trajectories.• We prove that the supervised-pretrained transformer will imitate the conditional expectation of the expert algorithm given the observed trajectory (Section 3). The generalization error scales with both model capacity and a distribution ratio measuring divergence between the expert algorithm and the algorithm that generated offline trajectories.• We demonstrate that transformers can effectively approximate several near-optimal reinforcement learning algorithms by taking observed trajectories as context inputs (Section 4). Specifically, we show transformers can approximate LinUCB (Section 4.1) and Thompson sampling algorithms (Section 4.2) for stochastic linear bandit problems, and UCB-VI (Section 4.3) for tabular Markov decision processes. Combined with the generalization error bound from supervised pretraining and regret bounds of these RL algorithms, this provides regret bounds for supervised-pretrained transformers.• Preliminary experiments validate that transformers can perform ICRL in our setup (Section 5).• Technically, we prove efficient approximation of LinUCB by showing transformers can implement accelerated gradient descent for solving ridge regression (Appendix D.4), enabling fewer attention layers than the vanilla gradient descent approach inBai et al. (2023). To enable efficient Thompson sampling implementation, we prove transformers can compute matrix square roots through the Pade decomposition (Appendix E.3).

We introduce the WINOVENTI procedure, which adversarially exploits generic associations in masked language models to create model-specific Winograd-style entailment schemas.

While it is difficult to measure whether neural program synthesis methods have similar capabilities, we can measure whether they compositionally generalize, that is, whether a model that has been trained on the simpler subtasks is subsequently able to solve more complex tasks. In this paper, we characterize several different forms of compositional generalization that are desirable in program synthesis, forming a meta-benchmark which we use to create generalization tasks for two popular datasets, RobustFill and DeepCoder. We then propose ExeDec, a novel decomposition-based synthesis strategy that predicts execution subgoals to solve problems step-by-step informed by program execution at each step.

Have any research papers introduced a dedicated pre-training architecture designed to improve dense retrieval system efficacy?,Condenser: a Pre-training Architecture for Dense Retrieval,"Pre-trained Transformer language models (LM) have become go-to text representation encoders. Prior research fine-tunes deep LMs to encode text sequences such as sentences and passages into single dense vector representations for efficient text comparison and retrieval. However, dense encoders require a lot of data and sophisticated techniques to effectively train and suffer in low data situations. This paper finds a key reason is that standard LMs' internal attention structure is not ready-to-use for dense encoders, which needs to aggregate text information into the dense representation. We propose to pre-train towards dense encoder with a novel Transformer architecture, Condenser, where LM prediction CONditions on DENSE Representation.

Is there a method for measuring the critical errors that a dialogue system makes in its responses?,Chat-Oriented Dialogue Systems,"Despite tremendous advancements in dialogue systems, stable evaluation still requires human judgments producing notoriously high-variance metrics due to their inherent subjectivity. Moreover, methods and labels in dialogue evaluation are not fully standardized, especially for opendomain chats, with a lack of work to compare and assess the validity of those approaches. The use of inconsistent evaluation can misinform the performance of a dialogue system, which becomes a major hurdle to enhance it. Thus, a dimensional evaluation of chat-oriented opendomain dialogue systems that reliably measures several aspects of dialogue capabilities is desired. This paper presents a novel human evaluation method to estimate the rates of many dialogue system behaviors. Our method is used to evaluate four state-of-the-art open-domain dialogue systems and compared with existing approaches.

However, automatic evaluation in NLG is still dominated by similarity-based metrics, and we lack a reliable framework for a more comprehensive evaluation of advanced models. In this paper, we propose a unified multi-dimensional evaluator UNIEVAL for NLG.

Furthermore, thanks to the unified Boolean QA format, we are able to introduce an intermediate learning phase that enables UNIEVAL to incorporate external knowledge from multiple related tasks and gain further improvement. Experiments on three typical NLG tasks show that UNIEVAL correlates substantially better with human judgments than existing metrics.

Is there any work that attacks language models in dialogue generation?,White-Box Multi-Objective Adversarial Attack on Dialogue Generation,"Pre-trained transformers are popular in stateof-the-art dialogue generation (DG) systems. Such language models are, however, vulnerable to various adversarial samples as studied in traditional tasks such as text classification, which inspires our curiosity about their robustness in DG systems. One main challenge of attacking DG models is that perturbations on the current sentence can hardly degrade the response accuracy because the unchanged chat histories are also considered for decision-making. Instead of merely pursuing pitfalls of performance metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, we observe that crafting adversarial samples to force longer generation outputs benefits attack effectiveness-the generated responses are typically irrelevant, lengthy, and repetitive. To this end, we propose a white-box multi-objective attack method called DGSlow. Specifically, DGSlow balances two objectives-generation accuracy and length, via a gradient-based multiobjective optimizer and applies an adaptive searching mechanism to iteratively craft adversarial samples with only a few modifications. Comprehensive experiments 1 on four benchmark datasets demonstrate that DGSlow could significantly degrade state-of-the-art DG models with a higher success rate than traditional accuracy-based methods. Besides, our crafted sentences also exhibit strong transferability in attacking other models.",True,258546855,"""How does the DGSlow method improve the effectiveness of adversarial attacks against dialogue generation models compared to traditional accuracy-based methods?"",","""The paper 'White-Box Multi-Objective Adversarial Attack on Dialogue Generation' introduces DGSlow, a method that improves adversarial attack effectiveness on dialogue generation models by focusing on generating irrelevant and lengthy outputs.

Could you suggest research that examines how well structured pruning techniques perform in developing both small and precise models in natural language processing?,Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models,"The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression. The two predominant approaches are pruning, which gradually removes weights from a pre-trained model, and distillation, which trains a smaller compact model to match a larger one. Pruning methods can significantly reduce the model size but hardly achieve large speedups as distillation. However, distillation methods require large amounts of unlabeled data and are expensive to train. In this work, we propose a task-specific structured pruning method CoFi 1 (Coarse-and Fine-grained Pruning), which delivers highly parallelizable subnetworks and matches the distillation methods in both accuracy and latency, without resorting to any unlabeled data. Our key insight is to jointly prune coarse-grained (e.g., layers) and fine-grained (e.g., heads and hidden units) modules, which controls the pruning decision of each parameter with masks of different granularity. We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10× speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches. 2",True,247922354,"""How does the CoFi structured pruning method improve both model compression and performance in NLP models?"",","""In 'Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models,' CoFi combines coarse-grained and fine-grained pruning to create highly parallelizable and efficient NLP models.

Which paper measured how well the source-translation contribution by the translation model can be used to detect its own hallucinations?,"Detecting and Mitigating Hallucinations in Machine Translation: Model Internal Workings Alone Do Well, Sentence Similarity Even Better","While the problem of hallucinations in neural machine translation has long been recognized, so far the progress on its alleviation is very little. Indeed, recently it turned out that without artificially encouraging models to hallucinate, previously existing methods fall short and even the standard sequence log-probability is more informative. It means that internal characteristics of the model can give much more information than we expect, and before using external models and measures, we first need to ask: how far can we go if we use nothing but the translation model itself ? We propose to use a method that evaluates the percentage of the source contribution to a generated translation. Intuitively, hallucinations are translations ""detached"" from the source, hence they can be identified by low source contribution. This method improves detection accuracy for the most severe hallucinations by a factor of 2 and is able to alleviate hallucinations at test time on par with the previous best approach that relies on external models. Next, if we move away from internal model characteristics and allow external tools, we show that using sentence similarity from cross-lingual embeddings further improves these results.

Could you recommend research that employs a relaxed l0 regularization for structured pruning to downsize language models with transformer architectures?,Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models,"The growing size of neural language models has led to increased attention in model compression.

We also devise a layerwise distillation strategy to transfer knowledge from unpruned to pruned models during optimization. Our experiments on GLUE and SQuAD datasets show that CoFi yields models with over 10× speedups with a small accuracy drop, showing its effectiveness and efficiency compared to previous pruning and distillation approaches. 2",True,247922354,"""What is the CoFi method, and how does it achieve efficient model compression in Transformer-based language models?"",","""The paper 'Structured Pruning Learns Compact and Accurate Models' introduces CoFi, a task-specific pruning method that combines coarse-grained and fine-grained pruning of Transformer components, such as layers and heads.

What paper considers sensitive data issue when prompting large language model APIs?,Enhancing Small Medical Learners with Privacy-preserving Contextual Prompting,"Large language models (LLMs) demonstrate remarkable medical expertise, but data privacy concerns impede their direct use in healthcare environments. Although offering improved data privacy protection, domain-specific small language models (SLMs) often underperform LLMs, emphasizing the need for methods that reduce this performance gap while alleviating privacy concerns. In this paper, we present a simple yet effective method that harnesses LLMs' medical proficiency to boost SLM performance in medical tasks under privacy-restricted scenarios. Specifically, we mitigate patient privacy issues by extracting keywords from medical data and prompting the LLM to generate a medical knowledge-intensive context by simulating clinicians' thought processes. This context serves as additional input for SLMs, augmenting their decision-making capabilities. Our method significantly enhances performance in both few-shot and full training settings across three medical knowledge-intensive tasks, achieving up to a 22.57% increase in absolute accuracy compared to SLM fine-tuning without context, and sets new state-ofthe-art results in two medical tasks within privacy-restricted scenarios.

As all machine learning-based methods, they are as good as their training data, and can also capture unwanted biases. While there are tools that can help understand whether such biases exist, they do not distinguish between correlation and causation, and might be ill-suited for text-based models and for reasoning about high-level language concepts.

Which paper first combines different methods for uncertainty quantification in one?,Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification for Selective Text Classification in Ambiguous Tasks,"Many text classification tasks are inherently ambiguous, which results in automatic systems having a high risk of making mistakes, in spite of using advanced machine learning models. For example, toxicity detection in usergenerated content is a subjective task, and notions of toxicity can be annotated according to a variety of definitions that can be in conflict with one another. Instead of relying solely on automatic solutions, moderation of the most difficult and ambiguous cases can be delegated to human workers. Potential mistakes in automated classification can be identified by using uncertainty estimation (UE) techniques. Although UE is a rapidly growing field within natural language processing, we find that stateof-the-art UE methods estimate only epistemic uncertainty and show poor performance, or under-perform trivial methods for ambiguous tasks such as toxicity detection. We argue that in order to create robust uncertainty estimation methods for ambiguous tasks it is necessary to account also for aleatoric uncertainty. In this paper, we propose a new uncertainty estimation method that combines epistemic and aleatoric UE methods. We show that by using our hybrid method, we can outperform state-of-the-art UE methods for toxicity detection and other ambiguous text classification tasks 1 .",True,259370752,"""How does the Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification method improve selective text classification in ambiguous tasks according to the recent study by Vazhentsev et al.?"",","""The paper 'Hybrid Uncertainty Quantification for Selective Text Classification in Ambiguous Tasks' by Vazhentsev et al. introduces a method combining epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty to enhance classification accuracy in ambiguous text tasks such as toxicity detection.

I would like to understand the theoretical basis for using the nuclear norm of a weight matrix as a measure of complexity in linear models for probing tasks. Which paper should I refer to?,Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure,"The success of neural networks on a diverse set of NLP tasks has led researchers to question how much do these networks actually know about natural language. Probes are a natural way of assessing this. When probing, a researcher chooses a linguistic task and trains a supervised model to predict annotation in that linguistic task from the network's learned representations. If the probe does well, the researcher may conclude that the representations encode knowledge related to the task. A commonly held belief is that using simpler models as probes is better; the logic is that such models will identify linguistic structure, but not learn the task itself. We propose an information-theoretic formalization of probing as estimating mutual information that contradicts this received wisdom: one should always select the highest performing probe one can, even if it is more complex, since it will result in a tighter estimate. The empirical portion of our paper focuses on obtaining tight estimates for how much information BERT knows about parts of speech in a set of five typologically diverse languages that are often underrepresented in parsing research, plus English, totaling six languages. We find BERT accounts for only at most 5% more information than traditional, type-based word embeddings.",True,215238965,"""How does the paper 'Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure' argue against the idea that simpler probes are better for assessing linguistic knowledge in neural network representations?"",","""The paper 'Information-Theoretic Probing for Linguistic Structure' suggests that one should always use the highest performing probe available, even if complex, for a tighter estimate of mutual information.

Is there any paper about style transfer for stories?,StoryTrans: Non-Parallel Story Author-Style Transfer with Discourse Representations and Content Enhancing,"Non-parallel text style transfer is an important task in natural language generation. However, previous studies concentrate on the token or sentence level, such as sentence sentiment and formality transfer, but neglect long style transfer at the discourse level. Long texts usually involve more complicated author linguistic preferences such as discourse structures than sentences. In this paper, we formulate the task of non-parallel story author-style transfer, which requires transferring an input story into a specified author style while maintaining source semantics. To tackle this problem, we propose a generation model, named StoryTrans, which leverages discourse representations to capture source content information and transfer them to target styles with learnable style embeddings. We use an additional training objective to disentangle stylistic features from the learned discourse representation to prevent the model from degenerating to an auto-encoder. Moreover, to enhance content preservation, we design a mask-and-fill framework to explicitly fuse style-specific keywords of source texts into generation. Furthermore, we constructed new datasets for this task in Chinese and English, respectively.

Which paper first studied the efficiency robustness of multi-exit language models?,Dynamic Transformers Provide a False Sense of Efficiency,"Despite much success in natural language processing (NLP), pre-trained language models typically lead to a high computational cost during inference. Multi-exit is a mainstream approach to address this issue by making a tradeoff between efficiency and accuracy, where the saving of computation comes from an early exit. However, whether such saving from earlyexiting is robust remains unknown. Motivated by this, we first show that directly adapting existing adversarial attack approaches targeting model accuracy cannot significantly reduce inference efficiency. To this end, we propose a simple yet effective attacking framework, SAME, a novel slowdown attack framework on multi-exit models, which is specially tailored to reduce the efficiency of the multi-exit models. By leveraging the multi-exit models' design characteristics, we utilize all internal predictions to guide the adversarial sample generation instead of merely considering the final prediction.

To tackle this, we propose submodular RL (SUBRL), a paradigm which seeks to optimize more general, non-additive (and history-dependent) rewards modelled via submodular set functions which capture diminishing returns. Unfortunately, in general, even in tabular settings, we show that the resulting optimization problem is hard to approximate. On the other hand, motivated by the success of greedy algorithms in classical submodular optimization, we propose SUBPO, a simple policy gradient-based algorithm for SUBRL that handles non-additive rewards by greedily maximizing marginal gains. Indeed, under some assumptions on the underlying Markov Decision Process (MDP), SUBPO recovers optimal constant factor approximations of submodular bandits. Moreover, we derive a natural policy gradient approach for locally optimizing SUBRL instances even in large state-and action-spaces. We showcase the versatility of our approach by applying SUBPO to several applications such as biodiversity monitoring, Bayesian experiment design, informative path planning, and coverage maximization. Our results demonstrate sample efficiency, as well as scalability to high-dimensional state-action spaces.",True,260154786,"""What are the theoretical challenges and proposed solutions for reinforcement learning problems with non-additive, history-dependent rewards, as discussed in the Submodular Reinforcement Learning paper?"",","""The paper titled 'Submodular Reinforcement Learning' highlights the difficulty in approximating problems with non-additive, history-dependent rewards due to their formulation in submodular set functions.

This method recovers optimal approximations under certain Markov Decision Process conditions and is versatile across applications such as biodiversity monitoring and experiment design."" } ```"
Could you suggest a paper that introduces an approach to relation extraction that involves learning syntax dependency structures using a tree LSTM model?,Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks,"Because of their superior ability to preserve sequence information over time, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, a type of recurrent neural network with a more complex computational unit, have obtained strong results on a variety of sequence modeling tasks. The only underlying LSTM structure that has been explored so far is a linear chain. However, natural language exhibits syntactic properties that would naturally combine words to phrases. We introduce the Tree-LSTM, a generalization of LSTMs to tree-structured network topologies. Tree-LSTMs outperform all existing systems and strong LSTM baselines on two tasks: predicting the semantic relatedness of two sentences (SemEval 2014, Task 1) and sentiment classification (Stanford Sentiment Treebank).",True,3033526,"""How do Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks improve semantic representations for tasks like sentiment classification and semantic relatedness, according to the paper 'Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks'?"",","""Tree-LSTMs generalize LSTMs to tree structures, capturing syntactic dependencies which enhance semantic representation by processing sentence structures hierarchically.

What are the latest advancements in predicting suicidal tendencies using innovative feature extraction methods?,PHASE: Learning Emotional Phase-aware Representations for Suicide Ideation Detection on Social Media,"Recent psychological studies indicate that individuals exhibiting suicidal ideation increasingly turn to social media rather than mental health practitioners. Contextualizing the buildup of such ideation is critical for the identification of users at risk. In this work, we focus on identifying suicidal intent in tweets by augmenting linguistic models with emotional phases modeled from users' historical context. We propose PHASE, a time-and phase-aware framework that adaptively learns features from a user's historical emotional spectrum on Twitter for preliminary screening of suicidal risk. Building on clinical studies, PHASE learns phase-like progressions in users' historical Plutchik-wheel-based emotions to contextualize suicidal intent. While outperforming stateof-the-art methods, we show the utility of temporal and phase-based emotional contextual cues for suicide ideation detection. We further discuss practical and ethical considerations. 1 Amy Bruckman. 2002. Studying the amateur artist: A perspective on disguising data collected in human subjects research on the internet.

I'm exploring research that utilizes large datasets for the task of sentence simplification. Are there any prominent datasets sourced from Wikipedia that I could look into?,Sentence Simplification with Deep Reinforcement Learning,"Sentence simplification aims to make sentences easier to read and understand. Most recent approaches draw on insights from machine translation to learn simplification rewrites from monolingual corpora of complex and simple sentences. We address the simplification problem with an encoder-decoder model coupled with a deep reinforcement learning framework. Our model, which we call DRESS (as shorthand for Deep REinforcement Sentence Simplification), explores the space of possible simplifications while learning to optimize a reward function that encourages outputs which are simple, fluent, and preserve the meaning of the input. Experiments on three datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms competitive simplification systems. 1",True,7473831,"""How does the DRESS model use reinforcement learning for sentence simplification, and what datasets are utilized in its evaluation?"",","""The paper 'Sentence Simplification with Deep Reinforcement Learning' introduces the DRESS model that employs reinforcement learning to optimize sentence simplification via an encoder-decoder framework.
